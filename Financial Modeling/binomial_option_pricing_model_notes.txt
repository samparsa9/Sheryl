Arbitrage: Risk free profit
- Type 1: Putting up zero investment and have chance to increase returns
- Type 2: Receive initial credit, and have no risk of losing money

- V = initial investment

Type 1
- V0 = 0 : we are putting up no initial capital
- P(VT >= 0) = 1 : at terminal time, we have a 0% chance of losing money
- P(VT > 0) > 0 : at terminal time, there is a chance that we make money

Type 2
- V0 < 0 : we are receiving a credit
- P(VT >= 0) = 1 : at terminal time, we have a 0% chance of losing the credit

Law of One Price
- Say we have two portfolio, portfolio a and portfolio Bayes
- P(VTa = VTb) = 1, then V0a = V0b : if at terminal time, we know that the value of the two portfolios will be the same, then their values at time 0 will be the same

One Period Binomial Model Distribution
- We have two time states, t=0, representing current state, and t = T representing terminal state
- At t = 0, we have the C0, the derivative we are trying to price, S0, the stock price related to the derivative, and B0, value of money invested under a risk free rate
- Possibility 1 : 
    - S increases with probability u 
    - at t=T, Cu = max(0, uS0-k), where k is the strike price of the derivative
    - Su = uS0
    - BT = e^(rT)
- Possibility 2 : 
    - S decreases with probability a 
    - at t=T, Ca = max(0, aS0-k)
    - Sa = aS0
    - BT = e^(rT)
